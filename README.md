# Spot-Reading

A small GUI tool to test your reading speed _when text does not move_.

Words are printed to the center of the GUI at a given speed (words per minute, wpm) that can be set by the user. The user can increase or decrease the speed via two buttons on top of the GUI.

The spotreading package can be run with loaded text from a text file with a generator object. This allows to write custom objects for the text generation and simply feed it into the spotreading class' \_\_init\_\_ function.
